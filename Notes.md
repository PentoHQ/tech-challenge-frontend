`Features that can be added in future(or if I had more time) to make this app production ready`

- Use memo to improvise the performance
- We can let user modify the startData and endDate for the session alongside name
- Filters to the sessions list page to help user find the sessions seasily
- We can add loader while editing, deleting and creating session
- Right now I have used inline save and cancel button for editable input, we can create new component for them
  for reusability purpose (just like edit, delete, play button)
- Search sessions by name
- Once the app gets bigger we can have different util functions and move all the related functions in there
