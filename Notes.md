# Notes

Use this file to document whatever you may want.
Write down development notes, explanations of why you made certain decisions, problems that you found, anything!
Feel free to structure it anyway you want, with as many sections as you wish, make it yours!
But don't forget to commit it with the rest of your code ðŸ˜„
