# general:

for stylying I added a scss file for each component that required my intervention
for the loading indicators I wrote a Loader component and reused everywhere

# Center and style the global app indicator;

Did with flexbox

# Create a Timer component

I made use of a setInterval inside useEffect

# Add week and daily summaries

I don't know if it was am unmentioned bug, but before doing that I fixed the useMonthChat because was displaying the weeks of the year, no the months
Then I duplicated the same logic for weeks and days. I also moved all the hooks inside a hook folder for better organization of code

# Add a way to edit an existing session

For this one i frankly didn't find the schema for mutating a running session. If I've found i would just added a mutation in useRunningSession and then call it inide a Modal for editing the session name

# Make the list of sessions

I just made use of overflow, but I guess that if we plan to have very large lists we could use something like react-virtualized for performances

# SessionControls

I removed the duplicates of useRunningSession because they were new instances and the data was not in sync between the components.
I just left the one in main component and passed props to the others
I also added an error message as validation of the session input
