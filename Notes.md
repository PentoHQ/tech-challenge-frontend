# Note

- I have never used GraphQL before, but tried to learn basics and implemented update and delete session queries/mutations. So, please consider the weak implementations for GraphQL related code if any.

# Changes

Added `TOKEN` property with bearer value to .env

`Newly added components`:

- CenteredText : created generic component to place the text in center of the container, used at different places
- Timer : to show the actions sessions time (Updated unit tests/specs as per the changes in duration)
- ItemLabel: created generic component to show the session name and duration as a label for all sessions
- SectionHeader: to add header title for both sections(active session and sessions list)
- EditButton : to use under actions section on list page
- DeleteButton : to use under actions section on list page
- EditableInput : to enable inline edit feature for values with cancel and save button inside

`Modified components`

- ListItem : added itemlabel and editable input component (Updated unit tests/specs as well)
- FormRow : updated styling
- MonthChart : renamed this component with ChartContainer and using it as a generic one to show sessions data for month,today and week

`Flow changes`

- I have not done any changes related to workflow.

`Unit Tests / Specs`

- I have tried to verify and update the failing basic unit tests.

`UX changes`

- Have done many changes related to syling. Tried to make the UI simple, elegant and more readable for the user
- Sessions list page: I have created 2 sections for better user experience [active session, all sessions]
- ListItem: Here I have added delete session and edit session button. Apart from that used editableInput when we try to edit session

Planning to add following extra features:

`Overall`

- Add titles to the button or actions everywhere [Done]

`Main Page`

- Placeholder in the session name input [Done]
- Change session name and duration from column view to row view in sessions list page [Done]
- Add `Active Session` label [Done]
- Add titles to the session name and session elapsed time [Done]
- Add title and update styling to the active session row in header [Done]
- Delete session [Done]
- Total sessions/hours count [Done]
- Add section(active session and all session list) headers [Done]
- No sessions data label scenario [Done]

`Stats page`

- Day and week summaries with session count and hours

`Features that can be added in future(or if I had more time) to make this app production ready`

- Use memo to improvise the performance
- We can let user modify the startData and endDate for the session alongside name
- Filters to the sessions list page to help user find the sessions easily
- We can add loader while editing, deleting and creating session
- Right now I have used inline save and cancel button for editable input, we can create new component for them
  for reusability purpose (just like edit, delete, play button)
- Once the app gets bigger we can have different util functions and move all the related functions in there
- All string label and other static values should be moved to constants and use them.
- Should remove all the unwanted props for the newly created components(default props)

# Completed Taks

- [x] Center and style the global app `Loading` indicator;
- [x] Create a Timer component, make it tick and put it in place of the static string that shows the elapsed time of the active session;
- [x] Add proper loading indicators; `Added valid labels`
- [x] Add week and daily summaries. You can do it however you want, don't feel forced to do it as charts, and put them whenever you want; `Added dropdown to shuffle between today, week and month. Used current chart to show all data`
- [x] Add a way to edit an existing session. Again, feel free to do it in any way you prefer: a modal, an edit route, etc. The only requirement is that it should be possible to trigger it by clicking anywhere on the task row;`Added a way to inline edit the session name, also added way to delete the session`
- [x] Make the list of sessions at the main route scrollable without the page body having to scroll as well; `Added vertical scroll`
- [ ] Fix the bug that prevents the `RunningSessionControls` to properly update on changes (switchSession, stopSession, etc.); `Was not able to figure the exact issue/ask mentioned here`
- [x] Improve the application in any way want ðŸ˜„. `Tried my best to add as many features as possible within 2 days of time`
