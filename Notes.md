# Notes

Loader:
Added a Loader and Backdrop components. Loader can be used for individual loading components whereas the Backdrop can be used with the Loader to show app loading state.

TODO:

- Create context for app loading state to show Backdrop and Loader component
- Add Loader component to EditModal
- Create Types/Enums for size and color used by hygen template so that they are easier and quicker to refactor (DRY)
- Increase test coverage
