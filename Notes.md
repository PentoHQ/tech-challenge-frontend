# Notes

The following tasks have been completed:

- [x] Add proper loading indicators;
- [x] Center and style the global app Loading indicator;
- [x] Make the list of sessions at the main route scrollable without the page body having to scroll as well;
- [x] Create a Timer component, make it tick and put it in place of the static string that shows the elapsed time of the active session;

## Working on the app

Given this is the first time I've worked with storybook and enzyme, I've tried to pick these up whilst working on the above tasks. These are tools I'm extremely keen to work with on a daily basis and can already see the benefits. I would therefore ask that you please excuse me if there's anything I've missed at this stage with regards to these libraries and the way they're integrated within the new components.

On the whole, I've really enjoyed working on this app - this is exactly what I want to be working on on a daily basis as opposed to purely React websites. I would love to be able to work on these type of apps in my next role, with the opportunity to pick up new technologies such as the above and really progress as an Engineer, and I therefore feel like Pento would be an amazing fit for me.

Thank you and I look forward to speaking with you in due course.
