# Notes

Done next tasks:
* Created Timer component
* Created Loader component, added it for buttons and added loaders to the list of sessions
* Created Modal component. I had experience to implement them completely by myself and it wasn't a good idea ðŸ˜„ Since that time, I use the [library](https://github.com/davidtheclark/react-aria-modal)
* Added the ability to edit session
* Ordered the list of sessions in descending order by start date. It seems that it will be more comfortable to see the new session right after creating

I decided not to use library for date picker. It seems that native inputs are fine for that purposes, and they have
good support (except IE)
